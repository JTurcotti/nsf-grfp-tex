# nsf-grfp-tex
A formatting class and skeleton for NSF GRFP essays.

The NSF GRFP guidelines require 12pt font, one inch margins.
The .tex class and skeleton will provide that automatically and compress
several other space-consuming areas like the title and bibliography.

Note that the title compression is such that long titles will display on top of
the author and date fields. Take this as encouragement to keep titles short.
