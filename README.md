# nsf-grfp-tex
A formatting class and skeleton for NSF GRFP essays.

**Warning:** Please check that this formatting matches the current requirements
for the NSF GRFP. They may have changed since the last time this class was
updated. (If they have, feel free to file an issue or pull request!)

As of Fall 2020, The NSF GRFP guidelines require 11pt font, one inch margins.
The .tex class and skeleton will provide that automatically and compress
several other space-consuming areas like the title and bibliography.

**Note:** Your statements do NOT need to include title, name, or date (at least
as of Fall 2020). If you would prefer not to include these for style or space
reasons, simply do not include `\maketitle` in your document.

Long titles will break onto multiple lines, which will cut into your space for
the rest of the statement. You should keep your titles short.
